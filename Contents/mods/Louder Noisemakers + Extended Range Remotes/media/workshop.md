#title=Louder Soundmakers and 4X Range Remotes
#description=This mod adds louder versions of Wrist Watches, Digital Watches, Alarm Clocks, and Sound Makers.
Also, this mod adds Remotes that have Quadruple the range.

I play with Insane zombie population so this is a must for being able to move the hordes.

The watches are craftable by default.
Alarm Clocks and Soundmakers require the [i]Make Some Noise~!: Mod Your Stereo[/i] magazine.
4X Range Remotes require the [i]Crank It Up: TV Remote Modding Guide[/i] magazine.

These magazines can be found in any area that has electrical magazines at the same rarity.
