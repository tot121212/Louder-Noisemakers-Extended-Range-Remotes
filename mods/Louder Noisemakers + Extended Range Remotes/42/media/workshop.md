#title=Louder Digital Watches, Alarm Clocks, Noisemakers, and Extended Range Remote Controllers
##description=This mod adds louder versions of Digital Watches, Alarm Clocks, Noisemakers, and Extends the range of Remote Controllers.

I learned to program, so let's update this mod for B42 Unstable!

This mod should theoretically be compatible with anything due to item modifications being done directly, as opposed to creating new ones.

I play with "Insane" zombie population so these items are a must for being able to move hordes around.

"Wrist Watch" no longer have a louder alarm variant.
"Digtal Watch" are craftable by default.
"Alarm Clock" and "Noise Maker" require the [i]Make Some Noise~!: Mod Your Stereo[/i] magazine.
"Extended Range Remote Controller" require the [i]Crank It Up: TV Remote Modding Guide[/i] magazine.

These magazines can be found in any area that has electrical magazines at the same rarity.

Ranges:
[list]
[*]Digital Watch - 25 tiles
[*]Alarm Clock - 50 tiles
[*]Noise Maker - 150 tiles (This includes the Timer, Sensor, and Remote versions)
[*]Extended Range Remote Controllers - 28 tiles, 44 tiles, 60 tiles
